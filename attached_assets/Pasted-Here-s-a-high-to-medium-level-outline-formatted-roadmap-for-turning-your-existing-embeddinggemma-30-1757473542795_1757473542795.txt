Here’s a high-to-medium-level, outline-formatted roadmap for turning your existing embeddinggemma-300m setup into a unified CLI tool powered by Phi-2. No code snippets—just clear steps and gap-checks.

1. Define Your Modular Surface
Embedder

Uses google/embeddinggemma-300m to turn text into vectors

Retriever

Indexes and searches embeddings (e.g., FAISS or Chroma)

Generator

Runs Phi-2 (2.7 B) for response generation based on retrieved context

CLI

Ties everything together with a command-line interface (e.g., Typer)

2. Prepare Your Conda Environment
Confirm sentence-transformers and transformers are installed

Add your vector store library (FAISS/Chroma)

Install any quantization/runtime helpers for Phi-2 (GGUF, bitsandbytes, etc.)

Allocate model cache paths under your project (e.g., ./models/)

3. Acquire and Optimize Phi-2
Download the Phi-2 weights from Hugging Face or Azure AI Studio

Quantize to Q4/Q5 to fit within ~6–8 GB of RAM on your i5/16 GB rig

Validate loading speed and memory footprint in isolation before integration

4. Sketch Your Data Flow
User Input: typed command + query text

Embedding: call Gemma → vector

Retrieval: query vector → top-k document vectors

Context Assembly: stitch retrieved snippets

Generation: feed context + user prompt into Phi-2 → text answer

Output: print or save response

5. Fill Logic Holes
You need a vector store backend; plain in-memory lists won’t scale

Chunk larger documents before embedding (e.g., 500 token windows)

Watch Phi-2’s context window (typically ~2 K tokens) and trim if needed

Plan caching: don’t re-embed the same files on every run

Design a config file for model paths, thresholds, and CLI defaults

6. Organize Your Directory
Code
gemma-phi2-cli/
├── models/
│   ├── embeddinggemma-300m/
│   └── phi2-quantized/
├── data/
│   └── index/            # FAISS/Chroma files
├── src/
│   ├── embedder.py       # wraps Gemma
│   ├── retriever.py      # builds & queries index
│   ├── generator.py      # wraps Phi-2
│   └── cli.py            # Typer entry point
├── config.yaml           # model locations, hyperparams
└── README.md
7. Plan Your CLI Commands
init → create or update index from a target directory

search → semantic lookup, returns file names + scores

ask → retrieval + generation in one step

serve → optional local API for integrations
